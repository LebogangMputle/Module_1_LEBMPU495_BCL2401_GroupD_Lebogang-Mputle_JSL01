# Function: Validate Syntax
This JavaScript function is designed to validate the syntax of an input string retrieved from an HTML element with the id "petInput".
It checks whether the input string starts with the characters "pet_", followed by one or more digits, and then followed by one or more alphanumeric characters.

# How to use:
Ensure the HTML element with the id "petInput" exists in your HTML file.
Call the validateSyntax() function when needed on form submission or button click by typing the required string.
Then click the validate button.
Do not forget to link the javascript on your html file together with the styles.css.

# Regular expression explained:
/^pet_\d+[a-zA-Z]+$/

^ shows the start of the string.
pet_ matches the exact characters "pet_".
\d+ matches one or more digits.
[a-zA-Z]+ matches one or more uppercase or lowercase letters.
$ shows the end of the string.
